you can do whatever you want with this code as long as you:

1. give proper attribution (eg: link original github or theguly as author)
1. provide a sample of your beer
1. keep brewing

i'm of course not responsible for any issue during your fermentation phase.

drink responsibly (AKA avoid industrial beer)
